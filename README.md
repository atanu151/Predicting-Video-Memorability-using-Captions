# Predicting-Video-Memorability-using-Captions
This paper illustrates an approach to predict the memorability scores of short videos clips for the MediaEval Predicting Media Memorability Task. The method utilizes the caption features of the videos to develop models which aid in predicting the short-term and long-term memorability scores. The captions are processed using three different techniques to generate features which are fitted into three different models to predict video memorability. The results are compared, and weighted ensemble models are built using predictions of the best models. The ensemble models bettered the scores of the individual models.
